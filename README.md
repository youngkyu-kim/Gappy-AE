# GappyAE

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for numerical examples of the paper titled "[Gappy Data Reconstruction using Unsupervised Learning for Digital Twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07902)".
Note that an open-source FEM solver, [MFEM](https://mfem.org/) was used to generate training data. Please refer to the paper for more details. Since the size of the training data is large, we do not upload it here. The training data will be provided upon request via email at youngkyu_kim@berkeley.edu.
